## Webhooks (callbacks)

> We use standard [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io/) (v1.0) to deliver information asynchronously via [HTTP Protocol Binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/http-protocol-binding.md) about requests made to the AMLYZE API.

* You can find more information about the specs we are using in their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec).
* It is also possible to use one of the [official SDKs](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/SDK.md) to speed up integration with our system.
