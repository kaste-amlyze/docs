## Welcome

Workflow

An existing customer or operation that took place in the past → IMPORT

Creating a new customer or operation → EVALUATE

Double check the fields that are used in individually configured rules set and make sure those fields are provided with the request, because they may be not mandatory to successfuly send the request but without them some rules may not be working.

If during EVALUATE, case was generated → Human decision is required
